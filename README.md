# personal-website

## Introduction

Hi! I'm Irfaan Khalid, an incoming Software Development Engineer at Amazon in Manhattan, NY. I'm a huge fan of Node but I've never really satisfied my curiosity of how React works, so I decided to rebuild my personal website in React after building it in Vue about a year and a half ago.

I'm using [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@Preda/getting-started-on-building-a-personal-website-with-react-b44ee93b1710) and starter code to build my site. The tutorial uses React, React Router, and Express; I may use Koa instead of Express and focus on TypeScript instead.
