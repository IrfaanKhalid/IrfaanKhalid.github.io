Hi! This is my personal website built in Vue using Nuxt.js and deployed via Netlify.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000 (better than the alternative direcctly below)
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project in dist/ folder
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).g
